# Make POOL_OF_LETTERS dictionary (it's a constant variable) based on the README

def draw_letters():
    # Make an empty list called letter_bank
    # Create empty dictionary called letter_count_dict
    # develop for loop that iterates over sequence 10 times and appends to letter_bank
        # assign letter to random.choice taking in the keys of the POOL_OF_LETTERS dictionary
            # if letter doesn't match a key in letter_count_dict then add it with value of 1
            # elif letter matches
                # Check if value in letter_count_dict is less than POOL_OF_LETTERS
                    # If True, add one count to letter_count_dict
                    # Else, minus one from "i" or whatever our for loop variable is 
    # return letter_bank
